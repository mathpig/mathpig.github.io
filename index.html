<p>
  <a href="battle.html">Battle simulation between squares</a>
</p>
<p>
  No controls. 250 squares battle each other. Squares of the same color are on the same team. Note that shooting units may miss their targets and hit someone else or just have the bullets go off the map. When their targets are out of range, shooting units have their own movement rates for approaching their target. A full list of units is shown below.
</p>
<p>
  Melee units:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Warrior - Simply a normal melee warrior with normal movement speed.</li>
  <li>Big Warrior - A larger version of the warrior that is slower but has increased health and attack strength.</li>
  <li>Giant - An even larger version of the warrior. There is only one giant, which always spawns in the center on its own team, gray. It attacks everyone else.</li>
  <li>Vampire - A version of the warrior that has extremely rapid somewhat weak attacks, draining the health of an enemy live. It has the same health as a normal warrior, but is extremely slow.</li>
  <li>Rogue - A very small version of the warrior that is extremely fast and has rapid, high damage attacks, but has low health.</li>
  <li>Decoy - An imobile statue with high health that merely serves as a distraction for enemy teams to fight. Same size as a normal warrior.</li>
  <li>Minion - A small, fast version of the warrior with practically zero health and low attack strength but high attack speed. Never appears naturally; only summoned by summoners.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Ranged units:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Archer - A normal shooting unit. Same size as a minion; smaller than a warrior, larger than a rogue. Somewhat fast.</li>
  <li>Gunner - A rapid-fire version of the archer that has extremely quick attacks but with lower accuracy and low damage output. Has low health. Same size as archer. Quite fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Priest units [all ranged]:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Converter - A priest unit that is very slow and shoots rarely, but can convert enemy units to its own team by shooting gray balls at them. As large as a big warrior.</li>
  <li>Healer - A slow priest unit that shoots dark golden healing balls at allied units. As large as a warrior. Prefers healing wounded warriors over unharmed ones.</li>
  <li>Healththrower - Rapidly shoots small, weak healing balls with low accuracy at allied units. Same size as archer, extremely low health. Very fast. Prefers healing wounded warriors over unharmed ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Elemental mage units [all ranged]:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fire Mage - A fire mage that shoots fireballs that have some small instant damage but also sets whomever they hit on fire temporarily. If its target is frozen, the target will have the effects cancel out, but will lose extra health. If the target is poisoned, its poison will be removed. Burning units appear orange-red. Prefers non-burning units over burning ones. Same size as archer, has somewhat high health. Somewhat slow. Moderate health.</li>
  <li>Ice Mage - An ice mage that shoots freezing balls that have some small instant damage but also freezes whomever they hit temporarily. If its target is on fire, the target will have the effects cancel out, but will lose extra health. If the target is poisoned, its poison will be removed. Frozen units appear cyan. Same size as archer, has somewhat high health. Somewhat slow. High health.</li>
  <li>Poison Mage - A poison mage that shoots poisonous balls that have some small instant damage but also poison whomever they hit permanently. If the unit it strikes is already on fire or frozen, the poison effect will not be applied. Poisoned units appear dark green. Prefers non-poisoned units over poisoned ones. Same size as archer, has somewhat high health. Somewhat slow. Medium-high health.</li>
  <li>Flamethrower - Rapidly shoots small fireballs with low accuracy and low burning time. Prefers non-burning units over burning ones. Same size as archer, low health. Fast.</li>
  <li>Frostthrower - Rapidly shoots small freezing balls with low accuracy and low freeze time. Same size as archer, moderate health. Fast.</li>
  <li>Poisonthrower - Rapidly shoots small poisonous balls with low accuracy. Same size as archer, low-medium health. Fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Summoning units:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Summoner - Very slow with low health. Summons weak minions nearby every few seconds when close enough to an enemy.
</ul>
<p>
  Rather than reading about all the units here, it is more interesting just to observe them in combat.

  <a href="pig.html">Pig Game</a>
</p>
<p>
  <font color="red">
  Note: This game is particularly difficult; some levels are extremely hard or even impossible. If one is stuck on any particular level, feel through to use the pallatte to edit the level or skip to the next with a carrot.
  </font>
</p>
<p>
  A platformer in which you try to reach the carrot to beat each level. Dodge lava, spikes, and wolves. Can play single-player or multiplayer. One can also place blocks using the pallette to build their own level or select the carrot to skip levels.

  Controls:
</p>
<ul>

  <li>P to hide/show pallette for placing blocks. Click on a non-air block to delete it. Click on an air block to place your currently selected block from the pallette (default is decorative green shrub).</li>

<h2>Cookie Clicker</h2>
<a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/"
   target="_blank">Cookie Clicker</a>
<p>
You play cookie clicker by buying upgrade and buildings.
The goal is to make infinite cookies. At the start, you should click the big cookie to make 1 cookie at a time.
Each upgrade or building adds on to your cookies per second, which is written as Cps. I use to have 15 sextillion cookies (15*10^21), but I spent a bunch.
</p>

<h2>Burning Cargo</h2>
<a href="http://www.burningcargo.com/"
   target="_blank">Burning Cargo</a>
<p>
Burning Cargo teaches you touch typing while having fun.
The touch typing gets tougher as you go, and I finsished the game!
You deliver orders to make money and buy new planes, and there is a story you discover along the way.
Sadly, the game requires flash, which has been deprecated on most devices. :(
