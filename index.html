You play cookie clicker by buying upgrade and buildings.
The goal is to make infinite cookies. At the start, you should click
the big cookie to make 1 cookie at a time. Each upgrade or building
adds on to your cookis per second which is wrote as Cps. I have 7 sextillion cookies currently.

Burning Cargo teaches you touch typing while having fun.
The touch typing gets tougher as you go, and I got stuck at the "enter" key.
You deliver orders to make money, to buy new planes and there is a little story along the way.
