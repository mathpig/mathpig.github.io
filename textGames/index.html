<h1>Text Games (more are being added)</h1>

<p>
  Note: Some game instructions are not displayed here, because instructions are provided in-game for most of the following games.
  Click on each game without instructions to view the instructions internally, sometimes through a lighter atmosphere.

  <a href="ink.html">Ink Spill (based off of the real Ink Spill)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  You are given a sheet of paper colored in a variety of colors. Your goal is to manipulate the colors so that the paper is eventually one solid color.
  Ink flows from your starting square, marked X on the grid.
  A flood fill is performed on squares adjacent to the X and colors connected squares with a color of your choosing.
  Choose your color wisely to better increase the controlled area.
  Walls, marked W, block ink passage.
</p>
<p>
  If these instructions are somewhat confusing, refer to the real Ink Spill game for better ones.
  The only difference here is that there can be a variety of starting squares, rather than just the upper-left corner, and there are walls.

<p>
  <a href="numberTowers.html">Number Towers (based off of the Hero Wars advertisements, had to make my own in the end...)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  The towers are displayed individually, and the floors in each tower are numbered. Enter the number value of the floor you would like to attack.
  You have a certain amount of power, which should help you decide which enemies you are prepared to attack.
  Floors, either have normal positive integers, which are enemies with a certain strength value.
  You have a chance of winning against stronger enemies to make it more realistic, but weaker enemies can also sometimes beat you.
  Beating an enemy allows you to gain their power.
  This version also has power boosts, marked with a '+', and traps, marked with a '-'. These give a flat power gain/loss.
  Finally, there are potions, marked 'Potion'.
  You can either drink a potion, which randomly doubles, triples, halves, or divides your power by 3, or you can throw it at an enemy, which produces similar effects on the enemy.

  Like all games, these games too have their secrets.
  Major spoilers are presented in this section. Proceed with caution.

<p>
  None of the games that have been transcribed from Python so far have any easter eggs. Be on the lookout for more, however! :)
