  <a href="ink.html">Ink Spill (based off of the real Ink Spill)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  You are given a sheet of paper colored in a variety of colors. Your goal is to manipulate the colors so that the paper is eventually one solid color.
  Ink flows from your starting square, marked X on the grid.
  A flood fill is performed on squares adjacent to the X and colors connected squares with a color of your choosing.
  Choose your color wisely to better increase the controlled area.
  Walls, marked W, block ink passage.
</p>
<p>
  If these instructions are somewhat confusing, refer to the real Ink Spill game for better ones.
  The only difference here is that there can be a variety of starting squares, rather than just the upper-left corner, and there are walls.

<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  This is a turn-based game. To start, one enters the number of players and the team each player is a part of. If the players are all competing against each other, they should all have different team numbers.
  Each player's turn consists of three actions: moving, drawing a card, and sticking a pin in a nearby player.
  Players may optionally talk throughout the game, unless certain cards are in effect.
  The goal is to reach a castle at tile 30, granting the player who reaches it 100 points and ending the game.
  Each player rolls a pair of dice to decide how many squares they move.
  They then draw a card and must follow the instructions exactly.
  If a player draws the blessing or curse card, the blessing/curse is applied to their whole team.
  If a player draws the blessing card when they are cursed or the curse when they are blessed, the curse will outweigh the blessing and they will still be unable to stick pins into other players, although they will still be listed as "blessed" as well as "cursed."
  Then they may stick a pin in a nearby player, nearby meaning within three tiles, inclusive.
  If no player is nearby, they must stick a pin into their own player, making them lose 25 points.
  If they stick a pin into a different player, they gain 50 points and the player they stick the pin into loses 25.
  If a player is on tile 10 or 20, they have the option to stick a pin into a second, different nearby player, unless the player they stuck their first pin into was themselves (oof).
</p>
<p>
  The instructions for this game are similar to that of the 2D one, except the board is 1D, you can only move forward, and there are cards with special effects.
  This is one of my personal favorites.

  <a href="numberTowers.html">Number Towers (based off of the Hero Wars advertisements, had to make my own in the end...)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  The towers are displayed individually, and the floors in each tower are numbered. Enter the number value of the floor you would like to attack.
  You have a certain amount of power, which should help you decide which enemies you are prepared to attack.
  Floors, either have normal positive integers, which are enemies with a certain strength value.
  You have a chance of winning against stronger enemies to make it more realistic, but weaker enemies can also sometimes beat you.
  Beating an enemy allows you to gain their power.
  This version also has power boosts, marked with a '+', and traps, marked with a '-'. These give a flat power gain/loss.
  Finally, there are potions, marked 'Potion'.
  You can either drink a potion, which randomly doubles, triples, halves, or divides your power by 3, or you can throw it at an enemy, which produces similar effects on the enemy.

  <a href="senators.html">Senators (original; my favorite strategy game)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  The premise is that a group of senators are deciding on a law and soon become rather violent.
  Note that the board here loops around, so the left end is right next to the right end.
  There are nine seperate teams, each of which can be controlled by a player or an npc. These teams are color-coded and labeled 1 through 9. The dead are highlited in red and are labeled with a 0.
  The team numbers of players whose next turn will be skipped are highlited in red.
  The controls are as follows.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Victory to announce victory when only members of your team remain (as well as the dead). Announcing victory prematurely kills the senator performing the action.</li>
  <li>Knife right or knife left to stab the senator next to you.</li>
  <li>Bomb right, bomb center, or bomb left to set off a bomb on top of you or your neighbor. Bombs destroy the player they are placed on and their neighbors, and have a 50% chance of killing the person two seats to the left and also a seperate 50% chance of killing the person two seats to the right.</li>
  <li>Raise to raise a random person from the dead and put them on your team. If no senators are dead, the senator performing the action is killed instead.</li>
  <li>Pistol to shoot a particular senator. It has a 50% chance of killing your target, and a 25% chance of killing either neighbor. If you try to shoot an invalid player, yourself, or your direct neighbor, you are killed instead. Using the pistol makes the senator who used it lose a turn.</li>
  <li>Grenade to throw a grenade randomly. The grenade kills a random player and has a 50% chance to kill their left neighbor and a separate 50% chance to kill their right. The senator who throws the grenade will lose a turn.</li>
  <li>Skip to merely skip your turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This game is mostly self-explanatory; if these instructions are confusing, just go ahead and try it out.

<p>
  Voodoo Dolls 1D: Enter -1 as the player count to remove the 9 player count limit. This will cause poor board graphics, although the game will remain playable. <font color="red">[NOTE: THIS EASTER EGG HAS BEEN REMOVED]</font>
