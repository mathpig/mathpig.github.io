  <a href="castles.html">Castles (based off of Castle Crush, one of my favorite games; credit to them for troop statistics)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  In castles, your goal is to destroy the enemy castle, and theirs is to destroy yours. There are three lanes through which to do combat with. Each turn, you may either spawn a troop or fortify.
  Troops cost mana to spawn. Mana is slowly gained over time using an algorithm also from the real Castle Crush. Mana is also capped at 12.
  Each troop has a HP value and an attack strength. On each turn, the troop moves forwards on their lane if possible, then attacks an enemy troop if there is one in front of them, then attacks the enemy castle if they are in front of it, and then heals if applicable. Healing only applies to the dryad troop.
  Note that if a troop is spawned inside your castle when there is already an enemy on the same lane attacking it, the troop will be protected inside the castle and will hit the enemy with 2-3 times strength without getting damaged.
  Fortify allows your castle to gain hitpoints, but fortifying grows less and less effective the more you use it [also from the real Castle Crush].
  Note that one troop, the hollow knight, can never be killed, because whenever it is defeated, it switches sides and revives with full health.
  On the map, empty tiles are displayed as " --- ", your troops are displayed as " ???+" and enemy troops are displayed as "-??? ".
</p>
<p>
  Exact statistics are shown below.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dwarf: Denoted "DWF" in-game, costs 2 mana, has 818 HP and 54 ATK. [Same as real Castle Crush Lv. 9 Dwarf].</li>
  <li>Warrior: Denoted "WAR" in-game, costs 3 mana, has 515 HP and 129 ATK. [Same as real Castle Crush Lv. 9 Warrior].</li>
  <li>Unchained Demon: Denoted "UNC" in-game, costs 3 mana, has 1180 HP and 279 ATK. Each unchained demon on your side alive on the battlefield makes all actions cost 3 extra mana. This penalty is incurred on the enemy as well when they spawn unchained demons. [Same as real Castle Crush Lv. 4 Unchained Demon]. It only appears in the options 25% of the time due to its power.
  <li>Golem: Denoted "GLM" in-game, costs 4 mana, has 1718 HP and 70 ATK. [Same as real Castle Crush Lv. 9 Golem].</li>
  <li>Dryad: Denoted "DRY" in-game, costs 4 mana, has 536 HP and 151 ATK. Also heals 107 HP each turn after other actions. [Same as real Castle Crush Lv. 7 Dryad]. The dryad only appears in the list of troops you can currently spawn 50% of the time, as it is rather more powerful than it should be with its mana cost.</li>
  <li>Hollow Knight: Denoted "HLW" in-game, costs 4 mana, has 1823 HP and 193 ATK. Also switches sides and revives with full health upon death. [Same as real Castle Crush Lv. 1 Hollow Knight]. The hollow-knight is exceedingly powerful considering its mana cost, and only appears in the troop spawn list 12.5% of the time.</li>
  <li>Orc Warrior: Denoted "ORC" in-game, costs 5 mana, has 1394 HP and 151 ATK. [Same as real Castle Crush Lv. 7 Orc Warrior].</li>
  <li>Black Knight: Denoted "BLC" in-game, costs 10 mana, has 1823 HP and 526 ATK, making it the most powerful unit currently implemented. [Same as real Castle Crush Lv. 4 Black Knight]. Note that the black knight will not be available until the endgame, due to its extremely high mana cost. It only appears in the troop list 25% of the time due to its immense power.</li>
  <li>Fortify: Costs 2 mana and only appears 50% of the time after the user confirms they would not like to spawn a troop. Restores 2680 castle HP, but this restoration value is multiplied by 70% with each successive use. [Same as real Castle Crush Lv. 9 Fortify].</li>
  <li>The castles each start with 8869 HP, just by my choice because it feels comfortable. I did find this seemingly arbitrary value with some formula I invented on other Castle Crush statistics, but it was very messy and I forgot.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Refer to the real Castle Crush if these rules are confusing; this game is very similar.

  <a href="ink.html">Ink Spill (based off of the real Ink Spill)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  You are given a sheet of paper colored in a variety of colors. Your goal is to manipulate the colors so that the paper is eventually one solid color.
  Ink flows from your starting square, marked X on the grid.
  A flood fill is performed on squares adjacent to the X and colors connected squares with a color of your choosing.
  Choose your color wisely to better increase the controlled area.
  Walls, marked W, block ink passage.
</p>
<p>
  If these instructions are somewhat confusing, refer to the real Ink Spill game for better ones.
  The only difference here is that there can be a variety of starting squares, rather than just the upper-left corner, and there are walls.

  <a href="newVoodooDolls.html">Voodoo Dolls (1D version, more enjoyable than the 2D version)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  This is a turn-based game. To start, one enters the number of players and the team each player is a part of. If the players are all competing against each other, they should all have different team numbers.
  Each player's turn consists of three actions: moving, drawing a card, and sticking a pin in a nearby player.
  Players may optionally talk throughout the game, unless certain cards are in effect.
  The goal is to reach a castle at tile 30, granting the player who reaches it 100 points and ending the game.
  Each player rolls a pair of dice to decide how many squares they move.
  They then draw a card and must follow the instructions exactly.
  If a player draws the blessing or curse card, the blessing/curse is applied to their whole team.
  If a player draws the blessing card when they are cursed or the curse when they are blessed, the curse will outweigh the blessing and they will still be unable to stick pins into other players, although they will still be listed as "blessed" as well as "cursed."
  Then they may stick a pin in a nearby player, nearby meaning within three tiles, inclusive.
  If no player is nearby, they must stick a pin into their own player, making them lose 25 points.
  If they stick a pin into a different player, they gain 50 points and the player they stick the pin into loses 25.
  If a player is on tile 10 or 20, they have the option to stick a pin into a second, different nearby player, unless the player they stuck their first pin into was themselves (oof).
</p>
<p>
  The instructions for this game are similar to that of the 2D one, except the board is 1D, you can only move forward, and there are cards with special effects.
  This is one of my personal favorites.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="numberTowers.html">Number Towers (based off of the Hero Wars advertisements, had to make my own in the end...)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  The towers are displayed individually, and the floors in each tower are numbered. Enter the number value of the floor you would like to attack.
  You have a certain amount of power, which should help you decide which enemies you are prepared to attack.
  Floors, either have normal positive integers, which are enemies with a certain strength value.
  You have a chance of winning against stronger enemies to make it more realistic, but weaker enemies can also sometimes beat you.
  Beating an enemy allows you to gain their power.
  This version also has power boosts, marked with a '+', and traps, marked with a '-'. These give a flat power gain/loss.
  Finally, there are potions, marked 'Potion'.
  You can either drink a potion, which randomly doubles, triples, halves, or divides your power by 3, or you can throw it at an enemy, which produces similar effects on the enemy.

<p>
  <a href="senators.html">Senators (original; my favorite strategy game)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  The premise is that a group of senators are deciding on a law and soon become rather violent.
  Note that the board here loops around, so the left end is right next to the right end.
  There are two to nine seperate parties, each of which can be controlled by a player or an npc. These teams are color-coded and labeled 1 through 9. The dead are highlited in red and are labeled with a 0.
  The team numbers of players whose next turn will be skipped are highlited in red.
  The controls are as follows.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Victory to announce victory when only members of your team remain (as well as the dead). Announcing victory prematurely kills the senator performing the action.</li>
  <li>Knife right or knife left to stab the senator next to you.</li>
  <li>Bomb right, bomb center, or bomb left to set off a bomb on top of you or your neighbor. Bombs destroy the player they are placed on and their neighbors, and have a 50% chance of killing the person two seats to the left and also a seperate 50% chance of killing the person two seats to the right.</li>
  <li>Raise to raise a random person from the dead and put them on your team. If no senators are dead, the senator performing the action is killed instead.</li>
  <li>Pistol to shoot a particular senator. It has a 50% chance of killing your target, and a 25% chance of killing either neighbor. If you try to shoot an invalid player, yourself, or your direct neighbor, you are killed instead. Using the pistol makes the senator who used it lose a turn.</li>
  <li>Grenade to throw a grenade randomly. The grenade kills a random player and has a 50% chance to kill their left neighbor and a separate 50% chance to kill their right. The senator who throws the grenade will lose a turn.</li>
  <li>Sacrifice to kill your player but also a random enemy. This is most effective in the endgame to stamp out any rebellion when you have many senators. If no enemies remain, sadly only your player is killed, but you should have done victory anyways.</li>
  <li>Skip to merely skip your turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This game is mostly self-explanatory; if these instructions are confusing, just go ahead and try it out.

  Voodoo Dolls 1D: Enter -1 as the player count to remove the 9 player count limit. This will cause poor board graphics, although the game will remain playable. <font color="red">[NOTE: THIS EASTER EGG HAS BEEN REMOVED]</font>
