<h1>Text Games (more are being added)</h1>

<p>
  Note: Some game instructions are not displayed here, because instructions are provided in-game for most of the following games.
  Click on each game without instructions to view the instructions internally, sometimes through a lighter atmosphere.

</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
  You are given a sheet of paper colored in a variety of colors. Your goal is to manipulate the colors so that the paper is eventually one solid color.
  Ink flows from your starting square, marked X on the grid.
  A flood fill is performed on squares adjacent to the X and colors connected squares with a color of your choosing.
  Choose your color wisely to better increase the controlled area.
  Walls, marked W, block ink passage. Currently there is only up to one wall per grid due to certain edge cases, but this will hopefully soon be fixed.
</p>
<p>
  If these instructions are somewhat confusing, refer to the real Ink Spill game for better ones.
  The only difference here is that there can be a variety of starting squares, rather than just the upper-left corner, and there are walls.

  Like all games, these games too have their secrets.
  Major spoilers are presented in this section. Proceed with caution.

  Fortunately, none of the games that have been transcribed from Python so far have any easter eggs. Be on the lookout for more, however! :)
