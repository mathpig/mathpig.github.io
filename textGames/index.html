  <a href="ink.html">Ink Spill (based off of the real Ink Spill)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  You are given a sheet of paper colored in a variety of colors. Your goal is to manipulate the colors so that the paper is eventually one solid color.
  Ink flows from your starting square, marked X on the grid.
  A flood fill is performed on squares adjacent to the X and colors connected squares with a color of your choosing.
  Choose your color wisely to better increase the controlled area.
  Walls, marked W, block ink passage.
</p>
<p>
  If these instructions are somewhat confusing, refer to the real Ink Spill game for better ones.
  The only difference here is that there can be a variety of starting squares, rather than just the upper-left corner, and there are walls.

  <a href="newVoodooDolls.html">Voodoo Dolls (1D version, more enjoyable than the 2D version)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  This is a turn-based game. Each player's turn consists of three actions: moving, drawing a card, and sticking a pin in a nearby player.
  Players may optionally talk throughout the game, unless certain cards are in effect.
  The goal is to reach a castle at tile 30, granting the player who reaches it 100 points and ending the game.
  Each player rolls a pair of dice to decide how many squares they move.
  They then draw a card and must follow the instructions exactly.
  If a player draws the blessing card when they are cursed or the curse when they are blessed, the curse will outweigh the blessing and they will still be unable to stick pins into other players, although they will still be listed as "blessed" as well as "cursed."
  Then they may stick a pin in a nearby player, nearby meaning within three tiles, inclusive.
  If no player is nearby, they must stick a pin into their own player, making them lose 25 points.
  If they stick a pin into a different player, they gain 50 points and the player they stick the pin into loses 25.
  If a player is on tile 10 or 20, they have the option to stick a pin into a second, different nearby player, unless the player they stuck their first pin into was themselves (oof).
</p>
<p>
  The instructions for this game are similar to that of the 2D one, except the board is 1D, you can only move forward, and there are cards with special effects.
  This is one of my personal favorites.

  <a href="numberTowers.html">Number Towers (based off of the Hero Wars advertisements, had to make my own in the end...)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Instructions:
</p>
<p>
  The towers are displayed individually, and the floors in each tower are numbered. Enter the number value of the floor you would like to attack.
  You have a certain amount of power, which should help you decide which enemies you are prepared to attack.
  Floors, either have normal positive integers, which are enemies with a certain strength value.
  You have a chance of winning against stronger enemies to make it more realistic, but weaker enemies can also sometimes beat you.
  Beating an enemy allows you to gain their power.
  This version also has power boosts, marked with a '+', and traps, marked with a '-'. These give a flat power gain/loss.
  Finally, there are potions, marked 'Potion'.
  You can either drink a potion, which randomly doubles, triples, halves, or divides your power by 3, or you can throw it at an enemy, which produces similar effects on the enemy.

  Like all games, these games too have their secrets.
  Major spoilers are presented in this section. Proceed with caution.

<p>
  Voodoo Dolls 1D: Enter -1 as the player count to remove the 9 player count limit. This will cause poor board graphics, although the game will remain playable.
